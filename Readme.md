# givebloodsavelife

The major problem in India is people can't find the required blood group donor immediately when in need. Due to the lack of proper communication system between donor and blood bank and the patient, various lifes go in vain. Also sometimes this lead to mental illness of the relatives of the patient. 
So my idea for the app is that the needy can see the nearby donors and ping them for their help. The donor then can accept or reject the request for the help according to his will. If the donor accepts the help request, the needy and the donor can communicate via chat or share phone number and then can agree to meet the nearest blood bank.   


Few features which this open source project will have in long run
* Register user with their personal details along with phone number into the portal.
* Notify nearby registered user on their mobile number if there is a requirement of blood.
* Register all the blood bank in India with their active contact number.
* The idea is to recognize all blood donors with appreciation. 
* Showcase their effort on the website homepage and encourage them to be an active member of the campaign. 
* Notify the donors whenever their blood is being used to save a life.
